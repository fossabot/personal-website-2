				<h2>Hello there!</h2>
				<p>I am <b>Marco</b> from Italy, I live in the UK since October 2014 and I am a Full stack web developer.</p>
				My passion for drama and musical theatre had made me pack my whole world and move to this adventure.<br />
				I am married with Gaia and have two cats: Ella and Chloe.<br />
				I have worked in various places from Fastfood to Big name retailer but it's never been for me. <br />
				I have also studied Musical Theatre in London but I have been told I was not good enough so I've decided
				it was time to give myself the best shot. <br />
				After a decade I went back to what I've studied in high school: Computer programming and now here I am!<br />
				If you are more interested on my story or want to discuss contract opportunities give me a shout! My details are just below!<br />
				<h2> I am looking forward to hear from you </h2>
